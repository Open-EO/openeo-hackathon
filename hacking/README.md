## Ideas

The following list are proposals for possible features or extensions of openEO. You can either work on your own ideas or on one of the proposals: 

* [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/connect/) [integration](https://open-eo.github.io/openeo-api/v/0.3.0/apireference/index.html#/Authentication/get_credentials_oidc)
* Process Graph Storage
* GraphQL Wrapper for openEO: GraphQL is an evolving technology that is an alternative for RESTful services. This feature proposal aims to investigate into to the feasibility to provide a GraphQL endpoint for openEO.
* Extending the JavaScript client library
* Implementing a framework for back-end compliance testing
* Implementing Job Management in the openEO Python client
* Adding Authentication to the openEO Python client
* Extend the GEE back-end to support other GEE scripts: Do you have any Google Earth Engine script you want to run with openEO? We may be able to add the required processes to the back-end and run your script via openEO.
